# Event-Triggered Controller
Making a controller work on event triggering scheme that transmits data only in the case of an event (like an error) compared to a normal NCS that transmits data irrespective of its status. This not only helps in reducing the network pressure on communication channel but also increases its full load capacity.

## Challenges Faced and Overcame
Showing 2 different types of sampling from an NCS at the same time -> later solved using two system approach
